**Netdiscover** is a lightweight, active/passive network address discovery tool that is used to identify devices connected to a local network. It's particularly useful in environments where there is no DHCP server running and static IP addressing is used.


### **Key Features of Netdiscover:**
- **ARP Requests:** Netdiscover sends ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests to discover hosts on the local network. 
- **Active and Passive Modes:** 
  - **Active Mode:** In this mode, Netdiscover actively sends ARP requests to detect live hosts on the network.
  - **Passive Mode:** Netdiscover listens to network traffic passively to discover hosts without sending any requests.
- **Easy to Use:** It's simple and doesn't require complex setup, making it ideal for quick network scans.


### **How Netdiscover Works:**
When Netdiscover is executed, it broadcasts ARP requests to all devices on a network subnet. Devices that receive the ARP request respond with their MAC address, and Netdiscover captures these responses to map out which IP addresses are in use, along with the associated MAC addresses and hostnames (if available).


### **Installing Netdiscover:**
On most Linux distributions, you can install Netdiscover using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install netdiscover
```


### **Basic Usage:**
To scan a specific network range actively, you can use:

```bash
sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
```
- `-r` specifies the range to scan.
- `192.168.1.0/24` is the subnet to be scanned. In this example, it represents all IP addresses from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254.


### **Example: Discovering Devices on the Same Network**

Letâ€™s assume you are on a network with the IP range `192.168.1.0/24`, and you want to find all devices connected to the network.

1. **Launch Netdiscover in Active Mode:**

   ```bash
   sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
   ```

   - This command sends ARP requests across the entire `192.168.1.0/24` subnet.

   **Output Example:**
   ```
   192.168.1.2     00:14:22:01:23:45     1      9     unknown
   192.168.1.3     00:16:3e:3e:03:7a     1      3     unknown
   192.168.1.4     00:1a:a0:b7:4d:2c     1      3     unknown
   192.168.1.5     00:0c:29:68:1c:58     1      3     unknown
   ```

   - **192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3, etc.**: These are the IP addresses of the devices found.
   - **00:14:22:01:23:45, etc.**: These are the MAC addresses of the devices.
   - The last column (`unknown`) might display the device manufacturer or hostname if identifiable.

2. **Using Netdiscover in Passive Mode:**

   If you want to just listen to ARP traffic without actively sending ARP requests:

   ```bash
   sudo netdiscover -p
   ```

   - The `-p` flag tells Netdiscover to work in passive mode.

   In this mode, Netdiscover waits for devices on the network to communicate and logs their details. This is less intrusive but may take longer to discover all devices.


### **Practical Use Cases:**
- **Network Inventory:** Quickly discover all devices on a network and document their IP and MAC addresses.
- **Troubleshooting:** Identify devices with duplicate IPs or unknown devices on a network.
- **Security Audits:** Detect unauthorized devices connected to the network.


### **Conclusion:**
Netdiscover is a powerful yet simple tool for discovering devices on the same network. Whether you are managing a small home network or performing a quick audit on a corporate network, Netdiscover provides a quick and efficient way to map out connected devices using ARP requests.
