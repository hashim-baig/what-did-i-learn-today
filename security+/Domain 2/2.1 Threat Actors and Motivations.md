# Common Threat Actors and Motivations

Threat actors are individuals or groups who pose a threat to an organization's security. They vary in terms of skill level, resources, motivations, and objectives. Understanding these elements is crucial for developing effective security measures.

## Threat Actors

1. **Nation-state**
   - Nation-state actors are government-sponsored groups that conduct cyber operations. They are typically highly skilled, well-funded, and motivated by political, economic, or military objectives.
   - These actors can cause significant damage by targeting critical infrastructure, stealing state secrets, or disrupting national security. Their actions can lead to international conflicts.
   - **Example:** The Stuxnet worm, believed to be developed by the United States and Israel, targeted Iran's nuclear facilities to disrupt their nuclear enrichment program.

2. **Unskilled Attacker (Script Kiddies)**
   - Unskilled attackers, often called "script kiddies," lack deep technical knowledge and use pre-written scripts or tools to exploit vulnerabilities.
   - While less sophisticated, unskilled attackers can still cause disruptions, especially if they use powerful tools or target vulnerable systems. However, their impact is generally less severe than that of more skilled actors.
   - **Example:** A teenager using a publicly available tool to perform a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on a small website.

3. **Hacktivist**
   - Hacktivists are individuals or groups who use hacking to promote political, social, or ideological agendas.
   - Hacktivists can cause reputational damage, disrupt services, and expose sensitive data. Their actions are often publicized, leading to widespread attention and potentially significant consequences for the targeted organization.
   - **Example:** Anonymous, a well-known hacktivist group, has conducted attacks against organizations they perceive as oppressive, such as government agencies or corporations.

4. **Insider Threat**
   - Insider threats come from within the organization, such as employees, contractors, or business partners. They can be malicious or accidental.
   - Insider threats are particularly dangerous because they have access to internal systems and data. Their actions can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and long-term damage to trust within the organization.
   - **Example:** An employee disgruntled after being passed over for a promotion leaks confidential company data to a competitor.

5. **Organized Crime**
   - Organized crime groups are criminal organizations that use cybercrime as a means to generate income. They are typically highly organized and operate like businesses.
   - These groups can cause significant financial harm through theft, extortion, and fraud. They often target multiple organizations, leading to widespread disruption.
   - **Example:** A criminal organization using ransomware to extort money from companies, as seen in the case of the REvil ransomware group.

6. **Shadow IT**
   - Shadow IT refers to the use of IT systems, devices, software, applications, and services without the approval or knowledge of the IT department.
   - Shadow IT can introduce vulnerabilities and increase the attack surface, as these systems are often not monitored or secured by the organization's IT department.
   - **Example:** An employee uses an unauthorized cloud storage service to share work files, bypassing security protocols.

## Attributes of Actors

1. **Internal/External**
   - **Internal:** These are actors within the organization, such as employees or contractors.
   - **External:** These are actors outside the organization, such as hackers, nation-states, or organized crime groups.

2. **Resources/Funding**
   - **High resources/funding:** Nation-states and organized crime groups often have significant resources, enabling them to carry out sophisticated and sustained attacks.
   - **Low resources/funding:** Unskilled attackers and some hacktivists may have limited resources, restricting the scale and sophistication of their attacks.

3. **Level of Sophistication/Capability**
   - **High sophistication:** Nation-states, organized crime, and skilled hackers typically have advanced technical knowledge and capabilities, allowing them to exploit complex vulnerabilities.
   - **Low sophistication:** Script kiddies and less experienced hacktivists might rely on easily accessible tools, limiting the complexity of their attacks.

## Motivations

1. **Data Exfiltration**
   - The unauthorized transfer of data from an organization to an external location.
   - Data exfiltration can lead to breaches of confidentiality, loss of customer trust, and legal consequences.
   - **Example:** A hacker stealing customer data to sell on the dark web.

2. **Espionage**
   - Spying on an organization to gather confidential information, typically for political, military, or commercial purposes.
   - Espionage can lead to the loss of intellectual property, national security risks, and economic disadvantages.
   - **Example:** A nation-state hacking into a rival country’s defense contractor to steal military technology.

3. **Service Disruption**
   - Disabling or degrading services to cause operational issues.
   - Service disruptions can lead to lost revenue, customer dissatisfaction, and damage to the organization’s reputation.
   - **Example:** A DDoS attack that takes down a company's website, preventing customers from accessing services.

4. **Blackmail**
   - Forcing an organization or individual to take specific actions by threatening to release harmful information.
   - Blackmail can lead to financial loss and reputational damage if the organization is forced to comply with demands.
   - **Example:** A criminal group threatens to release sensitive company emails unless a ransom is paid.

5. **Financial Gain**
   - Attacks aimed at generating income for the attackers.
   - Financial gain is a common motivation for organized crime groups, and such attacks can result in significant financial losses for the victim.
   - **Example:** Ransomware attacks where attackers encrypt data and demand payment for decryption.

6. **Philosophical/Political Beliefs**
   - Actions motivated by a desire to promote or protest against specific political or social causes.
   - These attacks can lead to public embarrassment and undermine confidence in the targeted organization.
   - **Example:** A hacktivist group defacing a government website to protest against a policy.

7. **Ethical**
   - Actions taken based on a belief that they are morally justified, often associated with hacktivism.
   - While intended to expose wrongdoing, these actions can still cause damage to the organization’s reputation and financial standing.
   - **Example:** A hacker exposing a company’s unethical practices to the public.

8. **Revenge**
   - Attacks driven by a desire for personal or professional retribution.
   - Revenge attacks can lead to significant operational disruptions and financial losses.
   - **Example:** A former employee sabotaging a company’s systems after being terminated.

9. **Disruption/Chaos**
   - Motivated by the desire to cause disorder or confusion within an organization or society.
   - These attacks can lead to unpredictable and wide-ranging consequences, making them particularly dangerous.
   - **Example:** A hacker group launching random attacks on various infrastructure to create widespread panic.

10. **War**
    - Cyber operations conducted as part of broader military actions during conflicts between nation-states.
    - Cyber warfare can have devastating effects, leading to significant civilian and military casualties, as well as long-term instability.
    - **Example:** A nation-state launching cyberattacks on another country’s power grid to weaken its defenses before a military invasion.
