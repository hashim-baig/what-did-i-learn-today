# Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces

In cybersecurity, a **threat vector** is a method or path that attackers use to access a computer, network, or system to deliver a malicious outcome. An **attack surface** refers to all the points or areas where an attacker can try to enter or extract data. By understanding these concepts, organizations can better protect their assets and data.

## Message-Based Threat Vectors

1. **Email**
   - Emails can be used to deliver phishing attacks, malware, or malicious attachments. Attackers often impersonate trusted entities to trick recipients into clicking on harmful links.
   - **Example**: An employee receives an email appearing to be from their bank, asking them to verify their account details. The link directs them to a fake website that captures their credentials.

2. **Short Message Service (SMS)**
   - Attackers use SMS to send phishing links or malicious attachments to smartphones. This method, known as "smishing," exploits trust in SMS communication.
   - **Example**: A user receives a text message claiming to be from their mobile service provider, with a link to a supposed bill. Clicking the link installs malware on their phone.

3. **Instant Messaging (IM)**
   - Instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, or Slack can be exploited to spread malware, phishing links, or social engineering attacks.
   - **Example**: An employee gets a message on Slack from someone posing as their boss, asking them to urgently transfer funds to a specified account.

## Image-Based Threat Vectors

- Images can contain embedded malicious code or be used in steganography (hiding data within an image). Users viewing or downloading these images may unknowingly activate malware.
- **Example**: An attacker sends a seemingly harmless image of a cat to an employee. Hidden within the image is code that, when opened, exploits a vulnerability in the image viewer software, installing a keylogger.

## File-Based Threat Vectors

- Files such as PDFs, Word documents, and Excel sheets can contain malicious macros or scripts. Attackers use these files to deliver payloads when the file is opened.
- **Example**: A spreadsheet is sent to an organization, purporting to be a sales report. When opened, a hidden macro executes, downloading ransomware onto the victim's system.

## Voice Call

- Attackers may use voice calls to conduct vishing (voice phishing) attacks, where they impersonate legitimate entities to extract sensitive information from the victim.
- **Example**: An employee receives a call from someone claiming to be from the IT department, asking for their network login credentials to fix a supposed issue.

## Removable Device

- USB drives and other removable media can be preloaded with malware. When plugged into a computer, they can automatically execute malicious code.
- **Example**: An attacker leaves USB drives in the company parking lot. Curious employees pick them up and plug them into their work computers, inadvertently installing malware.

## Vulnerable Software

1. **Client-Based vs. Agentless**
   - **Client-Based**: Requires software to be installed on endpoints, which can become outdated or misconfigured, providing attack opportunities.
   - **Agentless**: Interacts with systems without requiring software installation. These can still be exploited through unpatched vulnerabilities.
   - **Example**: An attacker exploits a vulnerability in an outdated version of a client-based software application to gain unauthorized access to a system.

## Unsupported Systems and Applications

- Systems or applications that are no longer supported by the vendor do not receive security updates, making them vulnerable to attacks.
- **Example**: A hospital continues to use an old operating system no longer receiving security patches. An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in this system to access patient records.

## Unsecure Networks

1. **Wireless Networks**
   - Unsecured Wi-Fi networks can be intercepted by attackers using methods like eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - **Example**: A hacker sets up a rogue access point with the same name as a public Wi-Fi network, capturing data transmitted by users who connect to it.

2. **Wired Networks**
   - Even wired networks can be compromised if physical security is weak. Attackers can physically connect to a network or exploit vulnerabilities in network devices.
   - **Example**: An attacker plugs into an unused Ethernet port in a company’s lobby to gain unauthorized network access.

3. **Bluetooth**
   - Bluetooth connections can be exploited through vulnerabilities to access devices and data without the user's consent.
   - **Example**: An attacker uses a Bluetooth scanner to detect and connect to unprotected devices in a crowded area, extracting personal information.

## Open Service Ports

- Network devices have ports used for communication. Unsecured or unnecessary open ports can be exploited by attackers to gain access to systems.
- **Example**: An attacker scans a company's network and finds an open port used by a service with known vulnerabilities. The attacker exploits this port to breach the system.

## Default Credentials

- Devices or applications often come with default usernames and passwords. If these are not changed, they can be easily exploited.
- **Example**: A network camera retains its default credentials of "admin/admin." An attacker uses these credentials to access the camera feed remotely.

## Supply Chain Threats

1. **Managed Service Providers (MSPs)**
   - Attackers target MSPs to gain access to the clients they serve. Compromising an MSP can allow attackers to infiltrate multiple organizations.
   - **Example**: An attacker breaches an MSP's network, deploying ransomware across all the clients using the MSP’s services.

2. **Vendors**
   - Vendors with access to an organization’s network or data can be exploited. Attackers compromise vendors to reach their clients.
   - **Example**: A software vendor unknowingly distributes software updates with malware embedded, affecting all clients who install the update.

3. **Suppliers**
   - Attackers target suppliers to introduce vulnerabilities or malware into the supply chain, affecting products before they reach end-users.
   - **Example**: A hardware supplier is compromised, and malware is installed on motherboards that are later distributed to numerous customers.
