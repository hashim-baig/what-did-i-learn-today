# Deception and Disruption Technologies

Deception and disruption technologies are cybersecurity measures designed to mislead attackers, gather intelligence on their methods, and protect real assets by diverting malicious activities. These technologies create fake resources or environments that appear legitimate to attackers but are actually traps or decoys.

## 1. Honeypot

A honeypot is a decoy system or network set up to attract cyber attackers and study their techniques. It appears to be a valuable target but is isolated and monitored to detect and analyze malicious activity without compromising actual assets.

**Example:**
A company sets up a honeypot that mimics a vulnerable web server containing fake sensitive data. The server logs all access attempts and captures details about the attackers and their methods. An attacker scanning the network finds the honeypot and attempts to exploit it, believing it's a genuine server. The company's security team can then analyze the attack patterns and improve their defenses accordingly.

## 2. Honeynet

A honeynet is a network of honeypots designed to simulate a larger, more complex environment. It provides deeper insights into coordinated attacks and more sophisticated threats.

**Example:**
A research organization sets up a honeynet that includes multiple servers, workstations, and network devices, all configured to look like a real corporate network. Cybercriminals targeting the organization's infrastructure engage with the honeynet, allowing researchers to observe the attack vectors and methods used across different network layers.

## 3. Honeyfile

A honeyfile is a decoy file deliberately placed in a system or network to lure attackers. These files typically contain fake or misleading information and are monitored to detect unauthorized access.

**Example:**
An organization creates a honeyfile named "Employee_Salaries.xlsx" and places it on a shared drive. The file contains bogus data and is set up with monitoring tools to alert the security team if accessed. An insider threat or a malware infection attempts to open the honeyfile, triggering an alert and providing the security team with details about the unauthorized access.

## 4. Honeytoken

A honeytoken is a piece of data or a token that, when accessed or used, indicates a security breach. It can be embedded in various parts of the network or applications.

**Example:**
A company embeds a fake API key (honeytoken) within its codebase. If the honeytoken is ever used, it indicates that the codebase has been accessed by an unauthorized party. A hacker gains access to the company's source code repository and finds the embedded API key. When they try to use it, the company receives an alert, indicating a security breach and enabling them to respond quickly.

## Summary

These deception and disruption technologies serve as proactive security measures, helping organizations detect and analyze malicious activities while protecting genuine assets. By misleading attackers with fake resources, security teams can gain valuable insights into threat actor behavior, improve their defenses, and minimize the risk of actual data breaches.
