The three key objectives (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) are the CIA triad.
Cybersecurity professionals use the CIA triad to describe risks, attacks, and security controls.

### 1. Confidentiality
**Purpose:** Ensure that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information.  
**Controls:** Firewalls, access control lists, and encryption.  
**Threats:** Attackers may try to access and disclose sensitive information without permission.  
**Examples:**  
- **Encryption:** Scrambles data so it can only be read by someone with the decryption key.  
- **Access Controls:** Use passwords, biometrics, and other methods to restrict access to information.

### 2. Integrity
**Purpose:** Ensure information and systems are not changed without authorization.  
**Controls:** Hashing and integrity monitoring solutions.  
**Threats:** Attackers or accidents (like power spikes) can alter or corrupt information.  
**Examples:**  
- **Checksums and Hash Functions:** Verify data integrity by creating a unique digital fingerprint of data.  
- **Version Control Systems:** Track changes to documents and code to prevent unauthorized alterations.

### 3. Availability
**Purpose:** Ensure that information and systems are available for legitimate users when needed.  
**Controls:** Fault tolerance, clustering, and backups.  
**Threats:** Attackers may try to disrupt access, or events like fires can destroy data centers.  
**Examples:**  
- **Redundant Systems:** Use backup systems to ensure continuous availability even if one system fails.  
- **Load Balancers:** Distribute network traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload and downtime.

### Nonrepudiation (Additional Concept)
**Purpose:** Ensure that someone who performed an action cannot deny it later.  
**Example:** Digital signatures confirm that a message truly came from the sender.

### Evaluating Risks to the CIA Triad
Cybersecurity professionals must assess threats and vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems and data. This involves identifying potential risks and implementing appropriate controls to mitigate them.
